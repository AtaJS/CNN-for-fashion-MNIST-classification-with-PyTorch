## Convolutional Neural Network for Fashion-MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It covers essential steps in developing a deep learning model, including dataset preparation, model building, training, and evaluation.

**Key Features:**

* **Custom Dataset**: Implementation of a PyTorch custom dataset for Fashion-MNIST, including data splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.
* **CNN Architecture**: Construction of a CNN model using convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and fully connected layers, tailored for image classification.
* **Training and Evaluation**: Development of training and evaluation functions to effectively train the CNN and assess its performance on validation and test datasets.
* **PyTorch Workflow**: Demonstrates a standard PyTorch workflow for image classification tasks, from data loading to model deployment.

**Dataset:**

* [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) - A dataset of Zalando's fashion articles, used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

**Libraries Used:**

* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* PyTorch
* Torchvision
* PIL (Pillow)
* onedrivedownloader
